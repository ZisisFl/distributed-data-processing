# Join Algorithms
This project is about the implementation of three different join algorithms over key value pairs stored in Redis databases. The algorithms are implemented in Java.

## Pipelined Hash Join

## Semi Join


## Intersection Bloom Filter Join

# Usage
In order to start up the two Redis stores using docker compose execute the following command:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

By default a redis1 service will start at port 5555 and redis2 at port 6666.
